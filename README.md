Welcome to freeCodeCamp Edmonton Chatroom!

1. Introduction:

As the name suggests is a chatroom app for freeCodeCamp students in Edmonton. The main purpose of this app is
to serve as a learning project, so all members of freeCodeCamp (not necessarily in Edmonton) are invited to
contribute to this project.

2. Chatroom:

The functionality is very simple, enter an username and chat. It will be a responsive app.

3. Components:

Design - There should be a window where messages are displayed  and a list of active users. When a user
leaves the chat the username should be removed.

Front-End - No especific technologies have been chosen until now so if you have any frameworks or libraries
in mind be user to make suggestions in our slack chat.

Back-End - Node.js, Express.js, socket.io and Redis. We might consider integrating a relational database if 
a "creat account" feature is developed.

If have suggestions as to what technology to use or questions contact me at fernandobarra2207@gmail.com
